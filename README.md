I tend to be afk or doing stuff while on ponytown, but if you whisper to me I will eventually answer back! I am very into league, cookie run, valorant, horror games of any kind, hollow knight, and baldur's gate. If you like these things I would be down to chill!

Some notes about me: Due to my mental illnesses I heavily connect with characters almost like plurality (not sure if theres a better term for it). In this case for me, I heavily associate myself with these characters:

$\color{#FF0000}{"-Grian"}$
$\color{#FF0000}{"-Candy~apple"}$
$\color{#FF0000}{"-SCP-963~(DNI~AB/JB~users"}$
$\color{#FF0000}{"-Black~forest"}$
$\color{#FF0000}{"-Kindred(Specifically~Lamb)"}$

I do not like fighting with people over ships, especially if they arent illegal or actually bad. I WILL NOT ARGUE ABOUT DECEIT POLYCULE, ME AND MY POLYCULE IRL HAVE CONNECTED OURSELVES TO DECEIT POLYCULE AND WE DO NOT WANT TO ARGUE WITH PEOPLE WHO SEE THEM AS FAMILY. We can just hold hands, I do not see anything wrong with family headcanons aslong as you dont use them to try and call me a bad person.
